#### Adding content

Adding content has been made as easy as possible (without turning this into a massive project that would take way to long). All one would need to do is add a markdown file or image file to the folder ```Work```, and run the ```update.sh``` script, it'll update all files that need updating, after which you only have to upload them to GitHub
